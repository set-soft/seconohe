    Sends a custom event to the frontend to perform an action on a node.

    This function communicates with a corresponding JavaScript listener for the
    ``seconohe-node`` event, instructing it to perform a specific action,
    such as changing a widget's value. It fails silently if not run within an
    active ComfyUI server environment.

    **Known Actions:**

    - **``change_widget``**:
      - ``arg1`` (str): The name (label) of the widget to change.
      - ``arg2`` (Any): The new value for the widget. The type should
        match what the widget expects (e.g., str, int, float).

    Example Usage::

        # To change a widget named 'seed' to the value 12345
        send_node_action(logger, 'change_widget', 'seed', 12345)

    :param logger: The logger instance for reporting errors.
    :type logger: logging.Logger
    :param action: The name of the action for the frontend to perform.
    :type action: Literal['change_widget']
    :param arg1: The first argument for the action. Its meaning depends on `action`.
                 Defaults to ``None``.
    :type arg1: Any
    :param arg2: The second argument for the action. Its meaning depends on `action`.
                 Defaults to ``None``.
    :type arg2: Any
    :param sid: The session ID of a specific client. If ``None``, broadcasts to
                all clients. Defaults to ``None``.
    :type sid: Optional[str]
